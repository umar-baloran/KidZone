This story begins in a little town in the south of Italy, where the only way of life was to 
cultivate the small land inherited generation after generation.
This one tells the story of a peasants family, formed by Anthony and Natalie, who were parents 
of Joan, Peter, Mary, Rose and Mimi.
<br /><br />
It wasn´t easy lo live there, because the second World War had finished not much time ago. But
they all worked hard without exception, to work and dominate the land; composed more of stones
that of productive land, what made the work even harder.
Being united, they could turn that arid land into fertile land, so, thanks to the harvest, they
were able to maintain the familiar economy, to live an honest life, with dignity, ,but without
any luxury.
One day, while they were making their daily hard work, were all surprised with the coming news;
there was a new heir on the way.
<br /><br />
The news generated many expectations, but the biggest expectation was Peter´s, who was the only
boy and wanted to have a “little brother”.
Time passed, and the expected baby was born. It was not a boy, actually, was a girl.
Peter´s disillusionment was so big that could not hid it. But Natalie, using mom´s wisdom,
getting everything they want from nothing, comforted him saying:
<br />
- “Son, you have to be happy with your new sister, you are going to name her”.
<br /><br />
Peter, was proud of it and came to his senses. This way Phoebe was born (It was the name of
Peter´s girl friend).
Phoebe began her life surrounded by nature, with her family. She went to the field every day.
While the others were working she was happy, had no worries, taking care of all of them, always
attentive.
But the little girl had demonstrated that had a problem since she was too small; she didn´t
like wearing the same clothes two days in a row, and there was no way to content her. It was
incredible to see how she could notice everything around being so small, crying when she did
not like something.
<br /><br />
So, Natalie intervened again, she didn´t talk too much, but she acted with wisdom. Do you want
to know what Natalie did?
…Took off the girl´s dress, she was anxious. Then she moved  away from her to hide her arms and
turned the dress over, looked at the girl and said:
- “Look! Mom just got you a new dress!
And the 3 year old girl, so innocent, wore her new dress happily.
