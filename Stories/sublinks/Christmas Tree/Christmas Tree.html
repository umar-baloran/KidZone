Once upon a time.
<br />
There was a golf stick called Golfy, who played golf every day in a golf links made to practice
this sport on the outskirts of the city.The golf stick was a marvelous golf player. He always won competitions and golf tournaments.
<br /><br />
Well…actually, not always…because one day, a new tree appeared on the golf links, called Little
tree, who really liked golf balls, and used to keep them to put them hanging from his own
branches on Christmas.The golf links carer really liked the tree, so Little tree became the golf links mascot…Golfy, the golf stick, got mad when found out who was the mascot, because Little Tree took away Golfy´s balls, and so he couldn´t play golf.When december arrived, Golfy bought Christmas balls to Little tree, to hang them from his
branches not to annoy him any more. But Little tree only liked golf balls…
<br /><br />
So, Little tree put all the golf balls he had, hanging from his own branches, to be an amazing
Christmas tree.
Golfy didn´t know what to do, so decided to strike a deal with Little tree, said: “Hi, Little
tree, you took away all my golf balls, those hanging from your branches…and I need them to play
golf. Could you give them back to me? I will give you these nice Christmas balls in exchange”.
The Christmas tree replied: “Golfy! Don´t try to trick me, golf balls are more beautiful than
those brilliant Christmas balls”.
Then, Golfy had a great idea: To paint the Christmas balls like golf balls, that is to say,
white and with small holes.
Went to visit Little tree and said: “Little tree, look, I give you these Christmas balls, that
look like golf balls. This way, you enjoy your ornaments and give me back my golf balls to
continue playing golf as always. What do you think?”.
<br /><br />
Little tree thought about it, realized that this way, both would win, and that he had been
selfish, he shouldn´t have disturbed Golfy. He should have searched for golf balls without
taking them away from anyone.
Especially during Christmas, is time to think of others, not only in yourself.
