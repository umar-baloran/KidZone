Long, long time ago, a boy called Franz was living in a city called Adventurevil. Franz loved
many people, his grandparents, his parents and his friends, who were living in the house beside
his, were called James and Sarah.Franz liked playing video games with the guys, because Sarah liked playing with her dolls.
<br /><br />
They used to meet up every night to talk about Franz´s dreams. He said that his last dream was
about pretty mermaids and beautiful fairies granting all kind of wishes.He also dreamed that the earth was amazing. Some people thought he was crazy, but he always said that, when he was sleeping, felt in other word.
His friends James and Sarah pretended they believed him, because cheered him up. Franz always.He was different form other children, because he dreamed with a fantastic world.
<br /><br />
Years passed, and Franz was travelling to different parts in the world, always telling what hedreamed. His friend Sarah had become one of the best ballet dancers in the world, and James wasan important layer.Each of them followed their dream, but they still see each other, and continue being very good
friends.
