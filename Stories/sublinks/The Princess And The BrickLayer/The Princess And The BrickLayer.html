Once upon a time…
<br />
There was a princess called Maggie, she was tall, white like the snow, had red lips like a rose,
her hair was brown, had light blue eyes and was very nice and kind.
She was in love with a bricklayer called kevin, was tall, had brown hair, white skin but always
tanned, was strong, had dark eyes, was kind, he was never angry and was very nice.
<br /><br />
He was also in love with her, but never said anything, not like Princess Maggie who told the
whole kingdom, the whole kingdom except his dad, because he was going to get angry. Her mom did
know everything.
One day, Maggie decided to tell her dad, he deserved it, she could not continue hiding the
secret to him.
Instead of telling him directly, prepared a surprise for Kevin. Sent him many flowers that
made the shape of the words: “I love you”. He was very happy and went running to the castle.
The princess was waiting for him, and they kissed. The father saw them, went untik them and
screamed:
<br />
- “None of my daughters will be with a bricklayer!”
<br />
And separated them.
<br /><br />
Maggi said: “It doesn´t matter what he is, everyone is equal, I love him above all. I you
loved me, you would let me be with him. Not just because one has more money than the other or
different surname means we are different”.
The father stayed quiet, after a few minutes said:
<br />
“Daughter, you are right, I love you and I allow you being with him, because yo love each other
and everyone is equal”.
