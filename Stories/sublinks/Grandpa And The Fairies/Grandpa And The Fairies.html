The fairies fly around to see grandpa. A nice man who has always lived giving love and
affection to his family.He looks for calm between the flowers and the fruits from his vegetable garden, and discovers
that he is picking the fairies´unconditional love, the same values he instilled in his family.One of the fairies called Shanna represents generosity, flapping happily towards grandpa, but
does not find the moment to offer her presents.
<br /><br />

The second fairy is called Sissi, she is solidarity, she is always ready to support, not just
Grandpa, also everybody around.Shelly, is the commitment fairy, she is always ready and does not leave undone things. A fairy
who always accompanies Grandpa, and takes care of him.Camila is the next, a naughty and lively fairy, who is happy of climbing the trees to collect her own fruits, but she always share them with everybody near grandpa.
