Ghosty was the king of the ghost, everybody in kingdom admired him, he was the best; the most
handsome, wise and good ghost for them.They all wanted to help him, every morning lots of volunteers were at the door of his castle
waiting to help him, he was never alone, always had someone to do things for him.
<br /><br />
One day the ghosts asked Ghosty to teach them everything he knew, first they asked him to show
them his scare methods, but Ghosty didn´t actually know it, because he had never done anything
himself. he said he was tired as an excuse and went to bed.The next day they asked him to show how to be so elegant like him, but he did not know it either and said: “I´m the only one so elegant, so forget it” and the rest said: “Oh! He is so smart!”then they asked him how could they be so smart, and he did not know what to say again. This made Ghosty think about it and realized that if they kept asking stuff would end up discovering how useless he was when nobody was helping him.
<br /><br />
So, he decided to stop lying and tell the truth: “You all think I´m the wise ghost just because
I´m the king, but can´t do anything on my own because you are always helping me, so from now on,
I will do everything without any help to get to be the king you all deserve!”
