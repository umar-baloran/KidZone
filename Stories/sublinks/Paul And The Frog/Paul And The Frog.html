Paul really likes playing at the field. His parents have a little house in a small town nearby
the city, and usually go every weekend. There, Paul can play near a small stream, where he can only wet his feet.Paul likes hunting bugs. Hunts crickets, frogs, fireflies…One day, caught a frog and put it inside a jar, when he was about to take the frog with his hand, the frog looked at him and
said:
<br /><br />
-”I will become a Prince if you kiss me”
<br /><br />
-”Ugh!!Disgusting!! I´m not kissing a frog!!” – screamed Paul – “And, Why do you want to be a
prince? nowadays everybody ignores princes, to be a talking frog is much better!!”
<br /><br />
The frog did not seemed to be convinced. He had always been waiting for someone to kiss him to
become a Prince. His life as a frog had just been, waiting and waiting, waiting and waiting…
<br />
But then, Paul told him that being a talking frog was amazing, unique in the world. Everybody
was going to be amazed, he could even become President! or Minister of the Environment! or
Minister assistant!
<br />
The frog was still not trusting him too much, who was going to pay attention to a frog?, but
accepted and went to Paul´s house.
<br />
- “You need a name, what was your name when you were a Prince?”
<br />
-”My name was William Baltimore III” – said the frog proudly.
<br />
-”Ok, now you are called Willy, ok?” – said Paul.
<br />
The frog was not too convinced, but accepted anyway.
<br />
The next monday, Paul took Willy to the school and there was a stir. Everybody wanted to see
the talking frog. Willy made more friends in only one day than in his whole life as a frog.
<br />
Willy was shocked, how could that be possible, so many people paying attention to him? he was
just a green frog, a bit sticky. Paul told him that he did not have to focus bad things, he had
to think about what made somebody unique and different from the others.
<br />
So, Willy forgot completely the idea of becoming a prince. Learnt to read and write, and read
maaaany books, and talked to maaaany people, he even appeared on television.
<br />
But he never forgot that was Paul who had taught him to live happy as a frog.
<br /><br />
Paul and Willy were friends forever.
