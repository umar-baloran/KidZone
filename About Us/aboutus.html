<h1>Our Website</h1>
It has been divided into 5 sections i.e.Maths, Science, English, Games, Stories and Rhymes.
<br /><br />
The Maths section includes counting with or without words, times table, addition, subtraction, 
multiplication, division, and shapes lessons. This section is supported 
by JavaScript to create interactive mathematical activities by taking input from the user and 
validating the given input by showing results of correct or incorrect.
<br /><br />
The Science section comprises of information related to the scientific reasoning of a kid's life.
A kid's exploration starts right from his/her own surrounding objects and pictures or even 
him/herself. Therefore, this section begins with basic concepts of science like what is science 
and vocabulary , parts of body names, animals, birds, flowers , fruits and vegetables.
<br /><br />
The English section includes lessons on ABC , Months Name , Days Name , Colors Name , Prayers and
Grammar. The English Section has been design in order to help the kids learn and enhance their 
English Vocabulary.
<br /><br />
The Games section is an online portal of educational games. The kids enter this section and find 
many games which are not only there to entertain them but also remind those lessons and also put
into practice which they just learned while navigating throught the pages of the Kids Zone. 
<br /><br />
The Stories Section is a fairy world for the kids. It contains different types of stories like
Fairy Tales , Ghost Tales , King and the Queen Stories and many more.
