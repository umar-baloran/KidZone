<h1><strong>Definition Of Science</strong></h1>
</div>

<div id="content">
<strong>The definition of science is the observation, identification, description, experimental 
investigation, and theoretical explanation of phenomena. It is in particular used in activities 
applied to an object of inquiry or study.

<br></br>
According to Webster's New Collegiate Dictionary,
<br></br>
"knowledge attained through study or practice,"
<br></br>
or
<br></br>
"knowledge covering general truths of the operation of general laws, esp. as obtained and tested 
through scientific method and concerned with the physical world."

<br></br>
The word Science comes from Latin word "scientia" meaning "knowledge" and in broadest sense it is
any systematic knowledge-base or prescriptive practice being capable of resulting in prediction. 
This is why science is termed as highly skilled technique or practice.
<br></br>
However, in more contemporary terms, science is a system of acquiring knowledge based on 
scientific process or method in order to organize body of knowledge gained through research.
<br></br>
Science remains a continuing effort on the part of human being to discover and increase knowledge
through research. Scientist make observations, record measureable data related to their 
observations, analyze the information in hand in order to construct theoretical explanations of 
phenomenon involved.

<br></br>
The methods involve in scientific research include making hypothesis and do experimentation to 
test the hypothesis under controlled conditions. In this process, scientists publish their works
so other scientists can do similar experiments in may be different conditions to further 
strengthen the reliability of results.
<br></br>
Scientific fields are broadly divided into natural sciences (to study natural phenomenons) and
social sciences (to study human behavior and societies). However, in both of these divisions,
the knowledge must be obtained through observations and capable of being tested for its validity
by other researchers working under similar conditions. There are some other disciplines like
health science and engineering that are grouped into interdisciplinary and applied sciences.
<br></br>
Most scientific investigations use some form of the scientific method. A scientific method tries
to explain the events of nature in reproducible way and allow using these reproductions to form
predictions.
<br></br>
Scientists make observations of natural phenomenon and than through experimentation they try to
stimulate natural events under controlled conditions. Based on observations, a scientist may
generate a model and then attempt to describe or depict the phenomenon in terms of mathematical
or logical representation. Scientist will than gather the empirical evidence and will generate
his/her hypothesis to explain the phenomenon.
<br></br>
This description is used to form predictions which in turn will be tested by experiment or
observations using scientific method. Evaluations are made which may prove hypothesis acceptable
or discard it altogether or recommend modifications.
